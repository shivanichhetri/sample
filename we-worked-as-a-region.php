                  <h1 class="">Living Himalayas Initiative</h1>
                  <p>WWF’s work in Nepal is part of Living Himalayas – WWF’s global initiative, which aims to bring the three governments of Bhutan, India and Nepal together to effectively manage and conserve the natural resources in the face of climate change for the sake of their unique people, their exceptional wildlife and their breath-taking environment. Combining connectivity and regional solutions, the initiative views the eco-region as a single unit and not a series of fragmented landscapes in separate countries. Wildlife trade, landscape management and development issues will be treated regionally, bringing people, government and industry together in the three countries and developing plans that straddle borders and landscapes.</p>

                    <h1 class="">Tigers Alive Initiative</h1>
                    <p>The tiger is iconic of Asia’s natural heritage and ecological integrity, and has wide cultural esteem. Unfortunately, due to extensive habitat loss and intensive poaching for their body parts, tiger populations across the range have shrunk alarmingly over the past five decades. Today tigers occupy a mere 7% of their historic range. WWF, recognizing that a wider paradigm shift is required if Asia’s top predator is to survive the next decade and beyond, is working to protect the tiger through its ambitious network-wide Tigers Alive Initiative (TAI). The TAI team proposes a bold plan to galvanize political will and take action to double the number of wild tigers by the year 2022, focusing on 13 tiger landscapes in the 13 tiger range countries. The Government of Nepal has shown exceptional commitment to TX2 and is working with WWF Nepal and its conservation partners to achieve the same.</p>

                      <h1 class="">Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy</h1>
                      <p>Asian elephants and all four Asian rhino species are amongst the most endangered large mammals in the world and their numbers are falling at some of the critical biodiversity sites. WWF is doing its best to halt this trend and initiated a suite of conservation activities for these important species under a comprehensive program called AREAS (Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy) and based the regional HQ in WWF Nepal Program since the year 2000. The overall objective is that the WWF AREAS program is instrumental in achieving conservation results through interventions by WWF and interventions of partner organizations (governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders) so that Asian elephant and rhino populations are viable in adequate habitats in 2020. It will do so by enhancing institutional capacity of WWF and partners through technical and policy support to contribute to the survival of viable populations of Asian elephants, greater one-horned, Sumatran and Javan rhinos in the wild. The program will also monitor at the regional level to measure the impact of WWF investments for the conservation of these four species of Asian pachyderms. Nepal aims to establish two viable rhino populations in Chitwan and Western Complexes.</p>
