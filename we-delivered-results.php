          <p>Nepal’s rhino population increased by an encouraging 21% based on the 2015 rhino count data. There are now presently 645 rhinos (the highest number recorded) as compared to the 2011 estimate of 534 rhinos in Nepal’s Terai Arc Landscape. The rhino count was conducted in Chitwan National Park (605 rhinos), Parsa Wildlife Reserve (3 rhinos), Bardia National Park (29 rhinos), Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (8 rhinos) and their buffer zones in the Terai Arc Landscape from 11 April-2 May. An increasing trend in rhino populations was observed in Chitwan National Park, Bardia National Park and Shuklaphanta Wildife Reserve. The count was conducted using a sweep operation where approximately 700 km2 of rhino habitat was systematically surveyed by mobilizing 54 elephants and 267 trained observers.</p>
          <p>The count was led by the government’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and Department of Forests in collaboration with WWF Nepal, National Trust for Nature Conservation, buffer zone communities and other partners.</p>

                  <p>Nepal marked yet another 365 days of Zero Poaching of rhinos for the period ending 2 May 2015. This makes it the third time in a span of five years that the country has been able to repeat this success. A coordinated response right from the central to the grassroots level, heightened protection measures within Protected Areas by the Nepal Army and buffer zone and community forests, and a clamp down on illegal wildlife trade by the Nepal Police and Wildlife Crime Control Bureaus (WCCB) are the key contributors towards Nepal achieving the zero poaching success. Nepal was able to achieve 365 days of zero poaching first in 2011 for rhinos, and for 12 months ending February 2014, for rhinos, tigers and elephants.</p>

                  <p>With a view to building an Asia-wide response against poaching, a symposium, Towards Zero Poaching in Asia, was successfully organized for the first time on 2-6 February 2015 bringing together representatives from the governments of 13 tiger range countries. Hosted by the Government of Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation with the technical and financial support from SAWEN, GTF, GTI, WWF’s Tigers Alive Initiative and the WWF Network, and NTNC, the symposium served to widen knowledge and learnings on different country-wide antipoaching measures while developing a Zero Poaching Toolkit to serve as a benchmark for countries to assess their own positions and statuses towards achieving zero poaching. At the symposium, Chitwan National Park also became the first site to be accredited as Conservation Assured Tiger Standard (CA|TS), demonstrating its excellence in tiger conservation and protection.</p><br>

                  <p>Nepal is on its way to receive additional funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) worth USD 7.5 million for the integrated conservation and management of the fragile Chure and associated ecosystems. The Ministry of Finance in the capacity of Operation Focal Point for GEF has committed to the GEF-6 project development which will be led by a consortium comprising the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation, Ministry of Agricultural Development, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, and WWF Nepal. The proposed GEF-6 project will focus on four focal areas in the Terai Arc Landscape: biodiversity conservation, land degradation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable forest management. In December 2013, WWF Inc. was formally accredited as the project implementing agency of GEF entrusted with the designing and implementing of GEF projects and funds. WWF Nepal became the first office in the WWF Network to pilot a three-year project under the GEF-5 replenishment from January 2014 focusing on sustainable forest management in Chure.</p>

                  <p>To contribute to the TX2 goal of doubling tiger numbers by 2022 and manage and increase rhino populations, as well as to safeguard the overall integrity of the forest ecosystem, the government endorsed the extension of Parsa Wildlife Reserve (PWR) in the eastern part of TAL by an additional core area of 128 sq. km. WWF is working towards a bold vision of the government to double tiger numbers by the next Year of the Tiger, and PWR, which is a potential TX2 site currently harboring 7-8 tigers, and its extension will help support additional habitat for tigers. This will also facilitate the dispersal of tigers, rhinos, wild elephants and other endangered wildlife in the protected areas of Nepal (Chitwan-Parsa Complex) and India (Valmiki Tiger Reserve).</p>

WWF Nepal is part of the drafting committee and is provided technical input to develop the ERPD. The ERPD will be a means to access performance-based payments under the REDD+ mechanism for the Terai Arc Landscape leveraging additional funds for local communities to support forest conservation activities while addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. The Government of Nepal’s REDD Implementation Centre will also receive an additional USD 5 million to help close the gaps identified in the REDD Readiness-package and USD 650,000 for developing the ERPD.</p>

The first phase of the biogas program which ended in 2012 helped bring biogas to 7,500 households in Nepal’s Terai Arc Landscape providing local communities an alternate fuel to firewood thereby helping protect forests which were the prime source of firewood for such households in the past. Additionally, the first phase brought in USD 2 million via the carbon financing modality of the program which will be channeled back to local communities to fund future biogas installations as well as community development programs.</p>
