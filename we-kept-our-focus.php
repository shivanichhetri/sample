          <p>Degradation of forests through slash-and-burn agriculture by poor families with no alternative is common in parts of Nepal. This practice disrupts biological corridors and causes soil erosion and landslides. Planting broom grass was the answer to rehabilitating degraded areas and improving livelihoods of local communities in Tanahun district, supported by the USAID-funded Hariyo Ban Program. From 2012 to 2014, local communities harvested approximately 110 metric tons of broom grass from 108 leasehold forests covering 226ha. Average annual household income increased by USD 66.25 for 782 poor families. At the same time soil erosion and stream sediment decreased and the forest started recovering, helping to restore the northsouth corridor linking Chitwan National Park with Annapurna Conservation Area.</p>
          <p>The Hariyo Ban Program is a five-year, USAID-funded program that aims to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change and threats to biodiversity in Nepal. It has three cross-cutting themes: livelihoods, governance, and gender and social inclusion. The program is being implemented by a consortium led by WWF in partnership with Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE), National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), and the Federation of Community Forestry Users in Nepal (FECOFUN).</p>

                  <p>A total of 580ha of forests were handed over to local communities benefiting 2,000 households in the Terai Arc Landscape. The community forestry program is a key pillar in conservation that has helped provide management and usage rights to local people for the sustainable management of natural resources. Through this program, WWF Nepal has strengthened community ownership and participation in conservation over time thereby nurturing a key ally in building conservation impact that provides mutual benefits for people and the environment.</p>

                  <p>A total of 1,200 households in TAL, SHL and CHAL benefitted from the implementation of community and local adaptation plans of action. These adaptation plans are key guiding documents that enable communities strengthen their adaptive capacity while enhancing ecosystem and community resilience to climate change. This helped enhance water, energy and food security for local households through small-scale drinking water and irrigation systems, improved cooking stoves, agro-forestry, and integrated pest management. Local households also benefited from the reduction of climate induced disasters through the construction of dykes and check dams, and bio-engineering while also engaging in forest and biodiversity conservation through nursery establishment, plantation and livestock grazing control.</p>

                  <p>About 4,000 households in Indrawati and Dudhkoshi sub-basins benefitted from improved access to water under the Koshi River Basin Management program implemented by the government’s Water and Energy Commission Secretariat with the support of WWF Nepal. The program, which works on the principles of integrated water resource management, promotes wise use of available water resources with the primary aim of building water security for local communities. As the impacts of climate change create water stress in Nepal’s rural communities, WWF Nepal’s freshwater program seeks to build community resilience whereby they are better empowered to manage available water resources for drinking and agricultural purposes while maintaining the ecological integrity and benefiting from the ecological services of the region.</p>
