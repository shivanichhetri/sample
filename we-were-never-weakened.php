                <p>Nepal witnessed a major turnaround in 2015 – a 7.8M earthquake on 25th April that left devastating effects on the country, its people and much of its cultural heritage. The months that followed were trying times for Nepal as people inched towards normalcy, gathering the pieces of yesterday while building back a tomorrow. The earthquake might have taken a lot; what it failed to take was the resilience of the people, a unified spirit and a common purpose of rising above adversity.</p>
                <p>During these very initial months since the earthquake, Nepal announced some of its biggest conservation successes – an increase of 21% in rhino numbers from 534 in 2011 to 645 (the highest number recorded since the 1950s), the achievement of 365 days of zero poaching of rhinos for a third time since 2011, and the collaring of a second snow leopard with satellite-GPS technology in Kangchenjunga Conservation Area. With stories and images of destruction and loss grabbing the spotlight, this positive news from the conservation world helped shine a new light on the state of the nation.</p>
                <p>WWF Nepal closed its fiscal year with these stories of hope, just as we began the year with fresh optimism and drive to deliver on our conservation promise. We made new headway in tiger conservation by working with the government to extend Parsa Wildlife Reserve, a potential TX2 site, providing expanded habitat for tigers.</p>

              <p>We helped successfully pilot a new patrolling technique that provides real-time information from patrol teams to the park headquarters to further strengthen wildlife protection efforts, while introducing such technologies and learning from others in the first-ever Symposium: Towards Zero Poaching in Asia hosted by the government. We are working with the government to bring new investments in conservation through engagements with the World Bank- Forest Carbon Partnership Facility in REDD+ and the Global Environment Facility in sustainable land management. And we are further empowering local communities and youth, our key allies in conservation, through the far-reaching community forestry and climate adaptation programs, and the ambitious The Generation Green campaign.</p>
              <p>What we have learned from these achievements and from a tragedy are two things – the power of resilience and the potential from working together. We are ever thankful to the government of Nepal, our conservation partners and the local communities for standing together in the good as well as trying times.</p>
              <p class="uppercase">Together, we have all emerged stronger. <br>Together, we will rise for a promise called Nepal .</p>
              <p>Here’s to new beginnings!</p>
