                  <p>A second snow leopard was successfully collared in Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (KCA). The snow leopard, an adult male approximately five years of age weighing 41 kg was captured near the village of Yangma (4,607 masl) in Kangchenjunga Conservation Area, fitted with a GPS-satellite collar and released back into the wild on 21 May 2015. Data received from the satellite collar will enable conservationists to identify critical habitats for the elusive species, including transboundary links across India and China. The first snow leopard was collared in KCA on 25 November 2013. Based on the post-release data received, this snow leopard covered an area of approximately 982 sq. km. between Nepal and India within a year of release, reaching a highest altitude of 5,858m – the highest documented so far for any species of cat around the globe.</p><br>

                  <p>Two rhinos – a sub-adult and adult female – were successfully collared in Khata Corridor on 27 November 2014 and 10 March 2015 respectively. Both the rhinos were fitted with a satellite-GPS collar, data from which will be key to providing conservationists with insights on habitat use and movement patterns of the rhinos in the trans-boundary corridor that links protected areas of Nepal and India and also help assess the thresholds of habitat restoration necessary to maintain a functional corridor for rhinos and other wildlife. Based on the telemetric data received from the collared rhinos, the home range of the sub-adult female and adult female rhinos was found to span over Nepal and India, covering the floodplains of Khata Corridor, Bardia National Park and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (India). </p>

                  <h1 class="">Real-time SMART patrolling</h1>      
                  <p>Nepal pioneered the use of Real-time SMART Patrols in 83 guard posts in all tiger-bearing protected areas of TAL except Parsa Wildlife Reserve. This new patrol technique developed by the Nepal Army in collaboration with WWF Nepal makes use of an android-based platform on mobile devices through which patrol teams record and update patrolling and locational data in real-time. The most productive outcomes of the implementation of Real-time SMART Patrol are that it has allowed for 24- hour monitoring of patrol teams together with providing immediate instructions on the ground, made the patrolling teams accountable, increased area coverage and frequency, and provided for paperless and prompt reporting to the headquarters. Real-time SMART Patrols are the latest addition in the use of technology to curb poaching and aid enforcement efforts within protected areas.</p>

                  <p>Someshwor hill forest is a trans-boundary corridor that connects Nepal’s Chitwan National Park with India’s Valmiki Tiger Reserve. An ecological monitoring study undertaken in the area in April 2015 helped unearth valuable information on the status of wildlife, primarily tigers, in the area making it an important site in TAL for future conservation programming. Based on a camera trapping methodology covering a total area of 244 sq. km, the study identified 11 individual tigers and the presence of all three co-predators, the common leopard, sloth bear and Asiatic wild dog. Of the 26 mammalian species identified overall, twelve were of high global conservation significance categorized as Endangered, Vulnerable and Near Threatened under ‘IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species’. </p>
