                  <p>WWF Nepal is working with the Ministry of Land Reform and Management to strengthen the National Land Use Policy incorporating the elements of hazards on land use planning. Critical engagements have also been initiated with stakeholders such as Nepal Electricity Authority, Department of Roads, Department of Railways, National Hydropower Association and the private sector on sustainable infrastructure development. As a key output, the Department of Railways is already examining the possibility of alternative alignments to change the proposed east-west railway that was planned through Chitwan National Park. The proposed railway cuts through prime wildlife habitat in Nepal’s oldest national park which is home to the highest population of tigers and rhinos.</p> 
                  <p>Following the earthquake on April 25th, WWF Nepal supported the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment to conduct a Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) of the immediate and post-impacts of the earthquake to the environment. A key outcome of the REA is a strategy for minimizing the impacts of recovery and reconstruction in order to build back better and greener and in a more environmentally sustainable manner across mulitple sectors.</p>

                  <p>A total of 50,000 youth signed up to WWF Nepal’s The Generation Green (TGG) campaign. The campaign, which seeks to build youth voice and action for the environment and Nepal’s sustainable development, has a target of creating 500,000 youth members within 2018. As one of the flagship projects of the campaign, a unique mentorship program was initiated bringing together 11 leading Nepali citizens from different sectors to mentor select TGG members. Under the mentorship program, TGG members conceptualized five projects focusing on environment sustainability, conservation education and waste management. Over the course of the campaign, youth will be provided opportunities to engage in various learning platforms, green projects and volunteering assignments with the end motive of building Nepal’s future leaders.</p>

                  <p>Kathmandu Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, came alive as more than five thousand people, mostly youth, from different walks of life turned up to celebrate Earth Hour in Nepal. Celebrated with the theme, Change Climate Change, and using music as the centerpiece, Earth Hour appealed to the youth to use individual and collective action towards protecting the planet. The event featured 1974AD, Nepal’s leading rock ensemble, and tied in with WWF Nepal’s The Generation Green campaign that gives Nepal’s youth a collective platform in engaging in environmental preservation and sustainable development. As part of the celebrations beyond the hour, WWF Nepal also launched the Earth Hour selfie contest via social media for youth to personalize individual actions and pledge to protect the planet.</p>

The competition received entries from 83 budding filmmakers from various districts of Nepal. “Penguin Revolution”, an animated video by Mr. Ishan Bhusal, was awarded the first prize, “Ghiling’s Greenhouse”, directed by Amitabh Raj Joshi, came second, while “Nature Never Forgives”, directed by Shankar Dhital claimed third position.</p>
